    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Ewomazino Josiah's profile picture">
    <p>Hello! My name is Ewomazino Josiah. I’m a student of WDD130 — Web Design and Development. This website is my learning portfolio where I practice HTML, CSS, and web design concepts. I enjoy creating beautiful, functional web pages and exploring how technology connects people.
       In my free time, I love exploring new creative ideas, reading, and improving my coding skills. And also learning how websites are built and how 
      design brings ideas to life. 
             I'm passionate about creativity, technology, and problem-solving. And also working on personal projects that help me grow as a developer.</p>
